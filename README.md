Here are my personal details / resume information:

Now, based on my details, I want you to generate a **complete professional LinkedIn profile** step-by-step including:

1️⃣ Profile Headline:  
A catchy, keyword-optimized headline (maximum 220 characters) that defines my role, skills, and impact.  
Example: "Java Spring Boot Developer | Tech Educator | Building Scalable Applications with AI & Cloud"

2️⃣ About Section:  
A powerful, story-driven About section (150–300 words) that highlights who I am, what I do, my achievements, and future goals.  
It should sound professional yet friendly.

3️⃣ Experience Section:  
For each role or internship mentioned in my resume, generate:
- Job Title

- 4–5 bullet points describing achievements and impact using action verbs.

4️⃣ Education Section:  
List all my degrees with:
- Institution Name

- Achievements / Activities (if available)

5️⃣ Projects Section:  
For each project, write:
- Project Title  
- Short Description (2–3 lines)

Create a categorized list of hard & soft skills.  
Example:

List all certifications from my resume with proper formatting.

8️⃣ Volunteer or Leadership Experience:  
If any, describe in 2–3 bullet points.

9️⃣ Achievements & Awards:  
Mention academic or professional recognitions.

10️⃣ Hashtags / Keywords Section (for Optimization):

11️⃣ Profile Banner Text Idea (for Canva or Thumbnail):  
Suggest a 1-line banner idea that visually represents my profile.

📌 Output Format:
